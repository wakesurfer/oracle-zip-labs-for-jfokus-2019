# Oracle Zip Labs for JFokus 2019 #

Here are a selection of labs you can try during JFokus 2019.
[Zip Lab 1](https://www.meetup.com/DiscoTech-By-Oracle/events/240960241/ "Lets Meetup and Connect Things to the Cloud"), you're at the right place!

## Introduction	##

This tutorial will walk you through the basic workflow on connecting a RaspberryPi with a temperature & humidity sensor to the Oracle IoT Cloud Service.

You will:

**[Part 1](instructions/devicemodel.md): Configure the Cloud Service**
1. Create a device model
2. Create an IoT application
3. Register your RaspberryPi as a trusted device
4. Download the provided code to your RaspberryPi using Git


**[Part 2](instructions/configure.md): Configure and test the Raspberry**
1. Configure your RaspberryPi to connect to the IoT Cloud Service
2. Test the sensor with a provided app.
3. Build the IoT client bit by bit from the provided code snippets (you don't need to be a programmer to complete this)
4. Test your client. When you are ready to test against the IoT Server **Part 1** need to be finished
5. Add some useful features to complete the client

Part 1 and 2 can be partly **parallelized**, so if you're a team - save time for the challenges and split up the tasks!

### Prerequisites ###

+ Laptop. SSH-functionality and knowledge (Putty/console for example)
+ A RaspberryPi with internet connection (provided in the meetup)
+ Credentials to an IoT CS instance (provided in the meetup)
+ If you have some knowledge of Git is helpful and also some programming skills is nice to have. However most parts of the tutorial that can be completed without any programming background at all. You might want to pick different roles in your teams depending on your interests and/or skills.
